= Setting up CI/CD pipelines

This guide describes how you create a CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests and deploys your XP apps with your favorite CI/CD service.

== CI/CD images

Enonic builds images specifically made to be used in CI/CD pipelines. Those images can be used with different CI/CD providers to create pipelines. Each image contains the newest minor version of `Enonic XP 7`, the newest version of the `Enonic CLI` and some other essentials for build pipelines. The image name format is `enonic/enonic-ci:<Minor Version><Optional Postfix>`. If you need Yarn or other Node tools, use the `-node` postfix images.

* `enonic/enonic-ci:7.12`
* `enonic/enonic-ci:7.13`
* `enonic/enonic-ci:7.12-node`
* `enonic/enonic-ci:7.13-node`

You can see a full list of https://hub.docker.com/r/enonic/enonic-ci/tags[available images on Docker Hub].

[#env-var]
== Environmental variables

NOTE: These variables are only needed if you plan to deploy your XP app in your pipeline.

* `ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_URL` is the address of the management port of the server you want to deploy to, i.e `https://myserver.com:4848` or `https://myserver.com:4443`.
* `ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_USER` is the user used to deploy.
* `ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_PASS` is the password of the respective user.
* `CLIENT_CERT` is an optional variable used only for mTLS based app deployment with github action
* `CLIENT_KEY` is an optional variable used only for mTLS based app deployment with github action
* `APP_JAR` is an optional variable in githubaction to set path and name of the jar file to be deployed. When not given, github action looks for a .jar file under build/libs. 


You can define multiple servers and based on some conditions pick the right server to deploy to. For now we will keep it simple, but if you want to see how that is done see section: <<complete-ci>>.

== CI/CD providers

Depending on your CI/CD provider the pipeline configuration may vary. In this section we will show how to do minimal configuration so that every time you commit to your repository your app will be built, tested and deployed.

[#complete-ci]
== Deploying with conditions

In this section we are going to take the pipeline a step further. Instead of building, testing and deploying on every commit, we will introduce some conditions.

=== Using Drone

==== Conditions

In this example our conditions will be:

* Deploy to testing server on:
** All pull requests to `master` branch
* Deploy to staging server on:
** All commits in `master` branch
* Deploy to production server on:
** All builds that are promoted to `production`

==== Drone CLI

To setup secrets and do promotions it is easiest to use the Drone CLI. So start by https://docs.drone.io/cli/install/[installing the Drone CLI].

Now you have to get your access token for the Drone CLI. You can find it in your user profile on the drone server. If you are using the Drone Cloud service https://cloud.drone.io/account[you can view it here].

To test your access token run the commands:

[source, bash]
----
export DRONE_SERVER=https://cloud.drone.io
export DRONE_TOKEN=<your_access_token>
drone info
----

==== Creating secrets

Now create secrets for testing, staging and production servers. To do this run the commands:

[source, bash]
----
ORG=<your_github_username_or_organization>

drone orgsecret add $ORG testing-url http://<xp_testing_server>:4848 --allow-pull-request
drone orgsecret add $ORG testing-user <xp_testing_user> --allow-pull-request
drone orgsecret add $ORG testing-pass <xp_testing_pass> --allow-pull-request

drone orgsecret add $ORG staging-url http://<xp_staging_server>:4848
drone orgsecret add $ORG staging-user <xp_staging_user>
drone orgsecret add $ORG staging-pass <xp_staging_pass>

drone orgsecret add $ORG production-url http://<xp_production_server>:4848
drone orgsecret add $ORG production-user <xp_production_user>
drone orgsecret add $ORG production-pass <xp_production_pass>
----

==== Create pipelines

Now we follow the same steps as before for <<drone>>, but now our `.drone.yml` looks a bit different:

[source, yaml]
----
kind: pipeline
type: docker
name: "Test Environment"

# Deploy to testing on pull requests to master branch
trigger:
  branch:
    - master
  event:
    include:
      - pull_request

steps:
  - name: build & test app
    image: enonic/enonic-ci:7.13
    commands:
      - /setup_sandbox.sh
      - enonic project build

  - name: deploy
    image: enonic/enonic-ci:7.13
    environment:
      ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_URL:
        from_secret: testing-url
      ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_USER:
        from_secret: testing-user
      ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_PASS:
        from_secret: testing-pass
    commands:
      - enonic app install --file build/libs/*.jar

---
kind: pipeline
type: docker
name: "Staging Environment"

# Deploy to staging push to master branch
trigger:
  branch:
    - master
  event:
    include:
      - push

steps:
  - name: build & test app
    image: enonic/enonic-ci:7.13
    commands:
      - /setup_sandbox.sh
      - enonic project build

  - name: deploy
    image: enonic/enonic-ci:7.13
    environment:
      ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_URL:
        from_secret: staging-url
      ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_USER:
        from_secret: staging-user
      ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_PASS:
        from_secret: staging-pass
    commands:
      - enonic app install --file build/libs/*.jar

---
kind: pipeline
type: docker
name: "Production Environment"

# Deploy to production on promoted builds
trigger:
  target:
    - production

steps:
  - name: build & test app
    image: enonic/enonic-ci:7.13
    commands:
      - /setup_sandbox.sh
      - enonic project build

  - name: deploy
    image: enonic/enonic-ci:7.13
    environment:
      ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_URL:
        from_secret: production-url
      ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_USER:
        from_secret: production-user
      ENONIC_CLI_REMOTE_PASS:
        from_secret: production-pass
    commands:
      - enonic app install --file build/libs/*.jar
----

==== Promoting builds to production

Once you are happy with a build that is running on the staging server, you can promote it to production. That is done by running the command:

----
drone build promote <your_github_username_or_organization/github_repo> <build_number> production
----

=== Using CircleCi

==== Conditions

In this example our conditions will be:

* Build app on:
** All commits
* Deploy to testing server on:
** All commits in branches called `feature-<SOMETHING>`
* Deploy to staging server on:
** All commits in `master` branch
** All tags
* Deploy to production server on:
** All tags with format `vX.Y.Z`, but only after manual approval. Note that tags have to strictly follow this rule so tag `v1.2.3-rc1` will for example not be deployed.

To do this we are going to use CircleCI and their workflow API.

==== Create contexts

Before we create the workflow, we first need to https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/#creating-and-using-a-context[create 3 contexts in our organization]. We will call them:

* `testing-server`
* `staging-server`
* `production-server`

Each of these contexts should have those 3 <<env-var>> to configure deployment to their respective servers.

==== Create workflow

Now we follow the same steps as before for <<circle-ci>>, but now our `.circleci/config.yml` looks a bit different:

[source, yaml]
----
version: 2.1

executors:
  xp-executor:
    docker:
      - image: enonic/enonic-ci:7.13
    working_directory: ~/app

jobs:
  build:
    executor: xp-executor
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Setup sandbox
          command: /setup_sandbox.sh
      - run:
          name: Build App
          command: enonic project build
      - persist_to_workspace:
          root: ~/app/build
          paths:
            - libs
  deploy:
    executor: xp-executor
    steps:
      - attach_workspace:
          at: ~/app/build
      - run:
          name: Deploy App
          command: enonic app install --file build/libs/*.jar

workflows:
  xp-ci-cd:
    jobs:
      - build: # Build and test all commits and tags (but not deploy)
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /.*/
            branches:
              only: /.*/
      - deploy: # Deploy feature-<SOMETHING> branches to test server
          name: deploy-testing
          context: testing-server
          requires:
            - build
          filters:
            branches:
              only: /^feature-.*/
      - deploy: # Deploy master branch and all tags to staging server
          name: deploy-staging
          context: staging-server
          requires:
            - build
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /.*/
            branches:
              only: master
      - deploy-prod-approval: # Require approval to deploy to production server
          type: approval
          requires:
            - build
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$/
            branches:
              ignore: /.*/
      - deploy: # Deploy tags with format vX.Y.Z to production server
          name: deploy-production
          context: production-server
          requires:
            - build
            - deploy-prod-approval
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$/
            branches:
              ignore: /.*/
----

Now push this file to your repository and you are done. Now you have a fully functional CI/CD pipeline for your XP app.

NOTE: To approve production deployments you have to open up your CircleCI project workflow page, pick running workflow that is on hold and approve the `deploy-prod-approval` job.

== FAQ

==== Build prompts a question to select sandbox

This happens when the entrypoint is overwritten the CI image. To fix this issue run the command `/setup_sandbox.sh` before `enonic project build` in your pipeline. This is done in the examples for <<drone>>, <<circle-ci>> and <<jenkins>>.
